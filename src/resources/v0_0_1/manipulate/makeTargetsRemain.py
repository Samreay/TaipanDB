# Compute the targets observed & remaining in individual tiles/fields

# Read-in tiles which do not have n_sci_rem and n_sci_obs defined

# Read in all science targets in two lists - those which are 'done', and
# those which are not

# For each field number, compute the n_sci_obs and n_sci_rem (store in a
# dict indexed by field ID)

# Construct a list to write back on a per-file basis

# Write the data back
