Table: ``tile``
===============

This table holds ranking information for a tile (e.g. scores, target numbers,
etc.)

    * - ``tile_pk``
      - serial
      -

      - True
      - Unique tile id
      -

        tiling_config
    * - ``field_id``
      - integer
      - None
      -
      - False
      - Field id for this tile
      -
      - Reference to :doc:`02.field`, and related tables
    * - ``n_sci_rem``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - How many priority science targets remain to be completed in this field?
      - We often change how 'priority science target' is defined, but the table
        itself is agnostic to this information.
      -
    * - ``n_sci_obs``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - How many priority science targets have been completed in this field?
      - We often change how 'priority science target' is defined, but the table
        itself is agnostic to this information.
      -
    * - ``n_sci_alloc``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - How many priority science targets are assigned to any pending tile (not
        just this one)?
      - We often change how 'priority science target' is defined, but the table
        itself is agnostic to this information.
      -
    * - ``n_done``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - How many targets of all kinds are marked done in this field?
      -
      -
    * - ``diff_sum``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - The sum of the difficulties of all science targets assigned to this tile
      -
      -
    * - ``diff_prod``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - The product of the difficulties of all science targets assigned to
        this tile
      - Currently not used - often causes bit overflows
      -
    * - ``prior_sum``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - The sum of the priorities of all science targets assigned to
        this tile
      -
      -
    * - ``prior_prod``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - The product of the priorities of all science targets assigned to
        this tile
      - Currently not used - often causes bit overflows
      -
    * - ``cw_sum``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - The sum of the 'combined weights' of the targets assigned to
        this tile
      - How 'combined weights' is defined is specified at runtime within the
        simulator/tiling code
      -
    * - ``cw_prod``
      - integer
      -
      -
      -
      - The product of the 'combined weights' of the targets assigned to
        this tile
      - Currently not used - often causes bit overflows due to large values
      -
